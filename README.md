## Stars, Not Screens
An interactive app leveraging Human Computer Interaction to nudge people to use less of their screens, using screens to fight against screens themselves. This was part of an Interactive Media Final Project for the class Creative Computing, Fall 2024.

<blockquote>“We used to look up at the sky and wonder at our place in the stars, Now we just look down and worry about our place in the dirt”</blockquote>

– Cooper, Interstellar (2014)

Once upon a time, we used to look up to the skies, soothing our souls with healing from heaven itself. Now we look down at our screens and wonder what’s wrong with ourselves. This piece is dedicated to giving the user a sense of wonder and amazement towards the heavens above, combatting the tyranny of screens, using a screen itself.

The p5.js sketch uses an iPad display and it’s sensors to display the vast sky when the device is pointed towards the skies. But when it goes back to a usual everyday-scroll-position, the scene immediately transforms into a grey-colorless-world with screens and users frantically scrolling to find the next high.

If the audience, upon interacting with this piece, spends even a moment of time wondering at how the skies are filled with majestic lamps that are decorated for us to marvel at, I would consider my efforts fulfilled.
